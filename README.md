# OpenScape-server
what: An open-source private server for the browser game Idlescape

how: Lots of energy drinks and staring at frontend code for hours

when: Not soon, lol. This will be a very long project, but I will do my best to push stable(?) updates daily

why: I have no respect for my own mental health! (I have way too much free time and want to feel productive)

This project was made possible by the sourcemaps **publicly** available [here](https://play.idlescape.com/static/js/main.8f2c20b5.js.map) and [here](https://play.idlescape.com/static/css/main.69e8dc36.css.map), but no frontend code or assets are provided by this repo in the interest of copyright. To run a private server yourself, you must extract and run the frontend from the above links yourself.
